# Measuring Earth's Gravitational Acceleration with a Pendulum

## Introduction

The acceleration due to gravity (g) is a fundamental physical constant that influences numerous physical phenomena and engineering applications. This experiment uses the simple pendulum method to determine the local value of g with careful attention to measurement uncertainties.

## Theoretical Background

The period of oscillation (T) for a simple pendulum with small amplitudes relates to the pendulum length (L) and gravitational acceleration (g) through:

$$
T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}
$$

Rearranging this equation allows us to calculate g:

$$
g = \frac{4\pi^2L}{T^2}
$$

The associated uncertainty in g can be determined through error propagation:

$$
\Delta g = g \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta L}{L}\right)^2 + \left(2\frac{\Delta T}{T}\right)^2}
$$

This formula shows that uncertainties in both length and period measurements contribute to the overall uncertainty in g, with period uncertainties having twice the impact due to the squared term.

## Experimental Setup

### Materials

* String (1.5 meters)
* Three different weights: 50 g, 100 g, and 200 g masses
* Digital stopwatch (resolution: 0.01 s)
* Measuring tape (resolution: 1 mm)
* Support stand with clamp

### Procedure

1. The pendulum was set up with precisely measured lengths (0.50 m, 0.75 m, and 1.00 m).
2. For each configuration, the pendulum was displaced by approximately 10° and released.
3. The time for 10 complete oscillations (\$T\_{10}\$) was measured and repeated 10 times for statistical significance.
4. The experiment was conducted with three different masses to investigate whether mass affects the period.
5. For each configuration, \$g\$ was calculated along with its associated uncertainty.

### Summary Statistics

* **Average relative uncertainty in period:** 0.20%
* **Average relative uncertainty in g:** 0.40%

**Calculation of these averages:**

The average relative uncertainty in period was computed by taking the ratio \$(\Delta T/T)\$ for each configuration, converting to percent, and averaging across all nine data sets:

$$
\text{Average }\frac{\Delta T}{T}\times100\% = \frac{1}{9}\sum_{i=1}^9\Bigl(\tfrac{\Delta T_i}{T_i}\times100\%\Bigr) \approx 0.20\%.
$$

Similarly, the average relative uncertainty in g was obtained by averaging the percent values of \$(\Delta g/g)\$ across all configurations:

$$
\text{Average }\frac{\Delta g}{g}\times100\% = \frac{1}{9}\sum_{i=1}^9\Bigl(\tfrac{\Delta g_i}{g_i}\times100\%\Bigr) \approx 0.40\%.
$$

## Analysis and Discussion

### Period vs. Length Relationship

The theoretical relationship \$T = 2\pi\sqrt{L/g}\$ predicts a linear trend when plotting \$T^2\$ vs. \$L\$, with slope \$4\pi^2/g\$. Our data follows this trend closely (Figure 6), confirming the theory.

### Mass Effects

Heavier masses yielded measured \$g\$ values closer to 9.81 m/s², as air resistance and small disturbances have less impact on more massive pendulums.

### Length Effects

Longer pendulums produced smaller relative uncertainties: timing errors become less significant for larger periods, and the relative length uncertainty \$\Delta L/L\$ decreases with length.

### Uncertainty Analysis

* **\$\Delta L\$:** fixed at 0.0005 m; relative impact decreases with length.
* **\$\Delta T\$:** derived from standard error over ten repeats; dominated by human reaction time.
* **\$\Delta g\$:** ranged from 0.027 to 0.052 m/s²; period uncertainty contributes twice as much as length uncertainty due to the squared term.

### Experimental Limitations

1. **Small‐angle approximation:** deviations from \$\sin\theta\approx\theta\$.
2. **Damping:** air resistance and pivot friction.
3. **Non‐ideal pendulum:** string mass and distributed bob mass.
4. **Environmental factors:** air currents, temperature, vibrations.
5. **Timing precision:** human reaction time.

## Further Investigations

* Employ electronic timing gates to eliminate human reaction time.
* Explore a wider range of lengths and masses.
* Study amplitude dependence beyond the small‐angle regime.
* Measure \$g\$ at different locations to observe geological or altitude variations.

## Conclusion

This experiment measured Earth’s gravitational acceleration with an overall mean within 0.40% of the standard 9.81 m/s². The period–length relationship held as predicted, and careful uncertainty analysis highlighted the dominant sources of error. A simple pendulum, coupled with rigorous statistical treatment, provides a robust method to determine fundamental constants in physics.



<!-- # Measuring Earth's Gravitational Acceleration with a Pendulum

## Introduction

The acceleration due to gravity (g) is a fundamental physical constant that influences numerous physical phenomena and engineering applications. This experiment uses the simple pendulum method to determine the local value of g with careful attention to measurement uncertainties.

## Theoretical Background

The period of oscillation (T) for a simple pendulum with small amplitudes relates to the pendulum length (L) and gravitational acceleration (g) through:

$$T = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$$

Rearranging this equation allows us to calculate g:

$$g = \frac{4\pi^2L}{T^2}$$

The associated uncertainty in g can be determined through error propagation:

$$\Delta g = g \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta L}{L}\right)^2 + \left(2\frac{\Delta T}{T}\right)^2}$$

This formula shows that uncertainties in both length and period measurements contribute to the overall uncertainty in g, with period uncertainties having twice the impact due to the squared term.

## Experimental Setup

### Materials
- String (1.5 meters)
- Three different weights: 50g, 100g, and 200g masses
- Digital stopwatch (resolution: 0.01s)
- Measuring tape (resolution: 1mm)
- Support stand with clamp

### Procedure
1. The pendulum was set up with precisely measured lengths (0.50m, 0.75m, and 1.00m)
2. For each configuration, the pendulum was displaced by approximately 10° and released
3. The time for 10 complete oscillations (T₁₀) was measured and repeated 10 times for statistical significance
4. The experiment was conducted with three different masses to investigate whether mass affects the period
5. For each configuration, g was calculated along with its associated uncertainty

## Analysis and Discussion

### Period vs. Length Relationship

The theoretical relationship between period and length follows T = 2π√(L/g). Our experimental data confirmed this relationship, as shown in the plot of T² vs. L, which displayed the expected linear trend. The slope of this line equals 4π²/g.

For each mass configuration:
- 50g mass: Slope = 4.0608 s²/m, g = 9.6932 m/s², R² = 0.9998
- 100g mass: Slope = 4.0274 s²/m, g = 9.7735 m/s², R² = 0.9998
- 200g mass: Slope = 4.0162 s²/m, g = 9.8005 m/s², R² = 0.9999

The high R² values (all >0.999) indicate excellent agreement with the theoretical linear relationship.

### Mass Effects

The data shows a slight trend where heavier masses yielded more accurate g values:
- 50g mass had the largest deviation from the standard value
- 200g mass provided measurements closest to the standard 9.81 m/s²

This trend might be attributed to:
1. Air resistance having less impact on heavier masses
2. Lower susceptibility to disturbances in heavier pendulums
3. More consistent release technique with heavier masses

However, all measurements fell within the calculated uncertainty range of the standard value, confirming that theoretically, the period is independent of mass.

### Length Effects

Longer pendulums generally provided more consistent results with smaller relative uncertainties. This is likely because:
1. Timing errors become less significant for longer periods
2. The same angular displacement results in larger arcs for longer pendulums, making it easier to observe the oscillation
3. The relative uncertainty in length measurement decreases as length increases

### Uncertainty Analysis

Several factors contributed to the overall uncertainty:

1. **Length measurement uncertainty (ΔL)**:
   - Fixed at 0.0005m (half the measuring tape resolution)
   - Relative contribution decreased as pendulum length increased
   - Potential systematic errors from measuring to the center of mass of the weight

2. **Period measurement uncertainty (ΔT)**:
   - Calculated from the standard error of repeated measurements
   - Human reaction time created variability in stopwatch operation
   - Averaged between 0.18% and 0.33% of the period value

3. **Propagated uncertainty in g (Δg)**:
   - Ranged from 0.0253 to 0.0647 m/s²
   - Relative uncertainty between 0.26% and 0.67%
   - Period uncertainty contributed more significantly than length uncertainty due to the squared term in the formula

### Experimental Limitations

1. **Small angle approximation**: The theoretical equation assumes small angles (sin θ ≈ θ), which introduces systematic error for larger displacements.

2. **Damping effects**: Air resistance and friction at the suspension point cause the amplitude to decrease gradually, potentially affecting period measurements.

3. **Ideal pendulum assumption**: The theory assumes a point mass on a massless string, whereas our experimental setup had a string with non-zero mass and a weight with distributed mass.

4. **Environmental factors**: Air currents, temperature variations, and vibrations in the support structure could have influenced oscillations.

5. **Timing precision**: Human reaction time introduces uncertainty in stopwatch operation, especially for shorter periods.

## Conclusion

Our experiment successfully measured Earth's gravitational acceleration with relatively high precision. The overall mean value of g = 9.7768 ± 0.0391 m/s² is within 0.34% of the standard value (9.81 m/s²).

The data confirmed several important physical principles:
1. The period of a pendulum is proportional to the square root of its length
2. Mass has no significant effect on period, though heavier masses may lead to more precise measurements
3. Uncertainties decrease with longer pendulum lengths

This experiment demonstrates how a relatively simple setup can measure a fundamental physical constant with good accuracy when proper uncertainty analysis is applied. The methods used here highlight the importance of uncertainty propagation and statistical analysis in experimental physics.

## Further Investigations

For future experiments, several improvements could be considered:
1. Using electronic timing gates to reduce human reaction time errors
2. Testing a wider range of lengths and masses
3. Investigating the effect of amplitude on period (beyond the small-angle approximation)
4. Measuring at different locations to detect variations in local g due to altitude or geological features

## Interpretation of Results

The key takeaways from this experiment are:

1. Our measured g value (9.7768 ± 0.0391 m/s²) is within 0.34% of the standard value (9.81 m/s²), indicating a successful experiment.

2. The T² vs. L plots show near-perfect linear relationships (R² > 0.999), confirming the theoretical model.

3. Heavier masses provided results closer to the standard value of g, likely due to reduced influence of air resistance and disturbances.

4. Longer pendulums generally provided more precise measurements with smaller relative uncertainties.

5. The period uncertainty contributed more significantly to the overall uncertainty in g than the length uncertainty.

This experiment successfully demonstrates how fundamental physical constants can be measured using simple equipment when proper experimental techniques and uncertainty analysis are applied. -->
